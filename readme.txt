Question 1 & 2 have been worked out as methods in the Java class Array.
For question 3 I have provided the necessary SQL code for the creation 
	of the database and tables contained in the Database folder as 
	well as the sql file.
The sql file also contains the SQL script for displaying the records
	as per the instructions given.
